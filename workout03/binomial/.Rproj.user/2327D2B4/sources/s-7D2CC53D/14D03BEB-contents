```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(binomial)
```

## Creating a binomial random variable
```{r}
X <- bin_variable(trials=10,prob=0.3)
```

#### This is printing it
```{r}
print(X)
```
#### This is forming the statistical summary of the random variable and printing it
```{r}
print(summary(X))
```
The summary outputs the measures of the variable:
- mean
- variance
- mode
- skewness
- kurtosis

### You can call separately those measures without creating the random variable
```{r}
bin_mean(10,0.3)
bin_variance(10,0.3)
bin_mode(10,0.3)
bin_skewness(10,0.3)
bin_kurtosis(10,0.3)
```

## Besides the measures, we have other functionality
#### Choose Calculator
This example is calculating choosing 3 iterms from 10 total items.
How many different ways are there?
```{r}
bin_choose(10,3)
```

#### This function outputs the probability given a binomial scenario
Example: Two successes out of 5 trials with a 30% success rate
```{r}
bin_probability(2,5,0.3)
```

#### There are also functions that get the entire distribution given the trials amount and the success rate
THe first one is just the pdf (the distribution), while the second one also includes the cdf (the cumulative distribution)
```{r}
dist <- bin_distribution(5,0.3)
cumu <- bin_cumulative(5,0.3)
```

#### Lastly we can also plot these dataframes
```{r}
plot(dist)
plot(cumu)
```
