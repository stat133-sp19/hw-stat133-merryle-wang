## Workout 1
This homework is about Golden State's top 5 players and their shot data during the 2016-2017 NBA season. We start with .csv files for each of the 5 players, and using R, we create shot charts, tables, and a report that explains the analysis and our findings from our data.

The Workout serves three purposes:
- working with a more complex file structure and using github
- practice analyzing NBA shot data
- producting a report with a narrative from our code and data
